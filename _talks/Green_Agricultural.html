<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p class="abstract">In recent years, the deterioration of the ecological environment has become a global issue, attracting worldwide attention. The topic of green agricultural development has also emerged as a focal point of discussion. To evaluate the effectiveness and outcomes of policies promulgated by the Chinese government to promote green agricultural development, this study constructs an evaluation model based on three dimensions: policy intensity, policy objectives, and policy measures. The model utilizes data collected manually from green agricultural policy documents issued between 2017 and 2022. The results indicate that the trend in the number of green agricultural policies issued aligns closely with the overall effectiveness of these policies, exhibiting periodic fluctuations. On average, the effectiveness of the policies remains relatively stable. Among the three dimensions, the average score for policy measures is the highest, suggesting the need to enhance the effectiveness of policy intensity and policy objectives to further improve the overall effectiveness of green agricultural policies.</p>
