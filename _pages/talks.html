    <h1>Research:</h1>
    <h2>Revised manuscript in Sci Zone 3 PLOS ONE: "Research on a Financial Fraud Identification Model by Fusing a Convolutional Neural Network."</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Proposed a financial fraud identification model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM)</li>
        <li>Visualization of feature contributions, feature correlation analysis.</li>
        <li>Compared the performance of CNN-SVM with LR, RF, XGBoost, and SVM, and perform statistical testing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The submitted manuscript: "Shareholder Networks, Information Advantages, and Corporate Digital Transformation."</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Studied the impact of shareholder relationship networks on digital transformation of Chinese listed companies.</li>
        <li>Found that these networks positively influenced digital transformation through "information advantages," especially among stable institutional investors.</li>
        <li>Weakened the effect in state-owned enterprises due to policy burdens, but compensation incentives strengthened it.</li>
        <li>Identified that economic policy uncertainty and marketization levels affected network value, with stronger effects in non-high-tech firms and eastern regions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The submitted manuscript："Assessment of the Effectiveness and Impact of Green Agricultural Policies: A Quantitative Analysis Based on Policy Texts from China (2017–2023)"</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Conducted a quantitative analysis of China's green agricultural policies from the perspective of policy texts.</li>
        <li>Derived indicators from the analysis as independent variables, with the SBM-GML index used to measure Agricultural Green Total Factor Productivity (AGTFP) as the dependent variable.</li>
        <li>Established a multiple regression model for empirical analysis of policy implementation effectiveness.</li>
        <li>Found that supply-side policy tools had a significant positive effect on agricultural green total factor productivity.</li>
        <li>Revealed that environmental policy tools had a significant negative impact on agricultural green total factor productivity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The submitted manuscript："Assessment of the Effectiveness and Impact of Photovoltaic Industry Policies: A Quantitative Analysis Based on Policy Texts from China (2005–2023)"</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantified and analyzed policies related to China's photovoltaic industry.</li>
        <li>Used the SBM-GML model to measure Green Total Factor Productivity (GTFP).</li>
        <li>Conducted empirical analysis on the impact of policy tools on GTFP.</li>
        <li>Found that both supply-side and demand-side policy tools had a significant positive effect on Green Total Factor Productivity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ongoing manuscript: "The Application of Media Coverage in Financial Distress Warning—Based on Bayesian Optimized LightGBM Model Construction and Empirical Research."</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyzed media reports on Chinese A-share listed companies using text mining and NLP techniques.</li>
        <li>Optimized LightGBM parameters with Bayesian methods to construct a financial fraud warning model.</li>
        <li>Found that Bayesian optimization significantly reduced the model's error rate.</li>
        <li>Identified negative media coverage as significantly related to financial distress warnings, considering biases and sentiment.</li>
    </ul>
