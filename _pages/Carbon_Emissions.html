<h1>Research on the Impact of Corporate Digital Transformation on Carbon Emissions</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p class="abstract">This study aims to explore the impact of corporate digital transformation on carbon emissions and its underlying mechanisms, enriching the research on the economic consequences of digital transformation, particularly its potential effect on carbon reduction. Through empirical analysis, the study verifies whether digital transformation can enhance the carbon reduction effectiveness of enterprises and provides new insights and theoretical support for promoting energy-saving and emission-reducing measures. Based on panel data from A-share listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2012 to 2020, this paper constructs regression models, mediation models, and moderation models to empirically examine the impact of digital transformation on corporate carbon emissions. The results show that corporate digital transformation significantly reduces carbon emissions by improving energy utilization efficiency, increasing the transparency of carbon emission information, and optimizing resource allocation. Moreover, the internal governance mechanisms of enterprises and the strengthening of external environmental supervision further promote the realization of this effect. Finally, the paper presents policy recommendations based on the research findings, aiming to provide theoretical guidance and practical insights for governments and enterprises in the process of green and low-carbon transformation.</p>
